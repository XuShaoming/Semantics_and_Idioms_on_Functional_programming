These files contains my solutions for the homeworks of CSE341: Programming Languages of University of Washington.The course link is https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse341/13sp/

The main purpose of this course is to help us to fully understand various paradigms and concepts of modern programming language by using three programming language --ML, Racket, Ruby.

In homeworks 1, 2 and 3, I implement a text processing library and a solitaire card game to investigate semantics and idioms such as pattern matching, tail recursion, high order function, closure, and currying on SML/Emacs tech stack.

In the homeworks 4 and 5 I implement an interpreter to create a new programming language MUPL which supports closure, recursion, list, lexical scope, and anonymous function etc., by using Racket as the metalanguage.

In the homeworks 6 and 7 I implement a new language for 2D geometry computation which is based on dynamic dispatch and inheritance to do pure object oriented programming on Ruby.
